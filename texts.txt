Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone. I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone. I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason. I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'. Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview. I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a week review. I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals. This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols. But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles. Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials. Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion. Pathological liar, blowing this out of proportion. The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic, impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict, half animal, half man.
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction; to get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action; a brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction; you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run; my rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills.
Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling... makes no difference. The degree is arbitrary. The definition's blurred. If I'm to choose between one evil and another... I'd rather not choose at all.
